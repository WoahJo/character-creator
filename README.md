# Character Creator  
  
Create a custom character for roleplaying games and other purposes!
  
This project was created with HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. Check it out [here](https://wj-character-creator.netlify.app/)!

## What's the point?  
  
This character creator was made with the hopes of removing a lot of the tedium associated with creating character sheets by hand.

## How does it work?  
  
Choose a preset attribute set from the drop-down menu, then set the point limit. The point limit must be greater than the number of attributes available. Fill out basic information about your character including name, age, gender and race. You can also include a backstory up to 1000 characters. Next, assign points to each attribute or leave it to chance and click `Randomize stats!` to randomly assign points. By clicking on `Click to add/edit image`, you can upload a `.jpg` or `.png` image of your character. Once you are satidfied with your creation, click `Print/Save` to print out a character sheet or save it as a PDF file. Should you run into any problems, clicking `Help` at the top of the page displays useful tips to get the most out of the app. 

## What did you learn?  
  
Throughout this project, my primary goal was to familiarize myself with React by rendering elements based on user input. This includes creating and using components, passing props, creating and updating state, rendering conditionally and referencing rendered elements. Though not at all related to React, I also learned how to print specific sections of a page and style them for printing. 
  
## What's next?  
  
This character creator is functional as it is, but there are some features and improvements I would like to implement over time: 
- create custom attributes 
- store created characters in a library for future use and easy updating
- more preset options based on other popular roleplaying games
